<p>
<b>Do You Think You're Able To Kill Coach In Heavy Rain?</b> is the 16th chapter of the fan fiction. The first
part focuses on <a href="https://commandtm.github.io/nosferatu-wiki/characters/trike-mike.html">Trike Mike</a>'s
introduction and ends with
<a href="https://commandtm.github.io/nosferatu-wiki/characters/jeff-jeffson-xxx">Jeff Jeffson XXX</a> attacking
The Fellowship of the Toppings and declaring his intention to kill <a href="https://commandtm.github.io/nosferatu-wiki/characters/coach">Coach</a>.
The second part unveils the trap that Jigsaw prepared for
<a href="https://commandtm.github.io/nosferatu-wiki/characters/richard-nixon.html">Richard Nixon</a> and
<a href="https://commandtm.github.io/nosferatu-wiki/characters/spongebob-squarepants">SpongeBob</a>.
  The third part reveals that Coach accidentally stole Jeff's gun.

<h2>Plot Summary</h2>
<hr>
<p>
  <h3>Part 1</h3>
  Following Trike Mike's arrival, Red Herring questions who he is. As Trike begins to make his way across the
  parking lot, Red Herring asks the rest of The Fellowship if that's Jersey Mike, and Luigi explains that Trike
  is the son of Jersey Mike and a high-ranking official, before Kenny cuts him off to clarify with clear disdain
  that Trike's role as the resistance's Secretary of Transportation is solely the result of nepotism, a sentiment
  which Coach agrees with. It is then revealed that Trike arrived while Luigi was still talking and was clearly
  impacted by what everyone said. After everyone gets on Trike's motorcycle, Luigi tries to diffuse the situation
  by saying that Kenny's harsh words were the result of stress. Kenny doubles down and goes off on Trike Mike,
  revealing that part of his bitterness towards him is because the resistance passed over him in favor of Trike
  for the role of Secretary of Transportation. At the end of Kenny's rant, Trike's bike is unexpectedly shot as
  Jeff Jeffson XXX arrives on horseback, intending to kill Coach.
  <h3>Part 2</h3>
  Richard Nixon wakes up handcuffed in the bathroom of Harry Reid International Airport. The bathroom was closed
  for rennovations, and there is a large gap in the ceiling, with a toolbag, ladder, and pane of glass
  on the floor beneath it. Also present is SpongeBob, who is dehydrated and chained to a cleaned urinal. After
  Nixon is done looking around, Jigsaw uses the airport intercom to explain Nixon's trap, which involves him
  "seal(ing) the watergate" using the tools at his disposal, with SpongeBob serving as his opponent, as he would
  presumably want the room to flood so that he can be rehydrated.
  <h3>Part 3</h3>
  We return to the streets of Vegas, where Jeff says Coach stole his iconic Magazine Fed Revolver, continuing
  to shoot at Trike's bike. While Jeff and Trike try to talk things out, everyone else looks to Coach for an
  explanation. Coach explains that he stole the gun by accident, as Jeff had left his gun in the armory with
  all of the other guns. When Red Herring points out that one of the first things Jeff said to them was that
  he didn't intend to give it away, quipping "Bro, try finding some Adderall under an authoritarian regime
  and then we can talk about that." in response to further pushback from Red Herring. Cutting their conversation
  short, Jeff resumes shooting.

The title of the chapter is a reference to a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/silverpapercat.bsky.social/post/3ldtq5hjgec23">post</a> on Bluesky and a play
on words referencing the fact that Jeff is literally trying to kill Coach as Las Vegas floods from the heavy rainfall.
This title receives an answer in the form of
<a href="https://commandtm.github.io/nosferatu-wiki/articles/chapters/chapter-28.html">chapter 28</a>'s title.
</li>
<li>
  This is the first chapter to feature multimedia.<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><i>citation needed</i></a>]</sup>
  It features a <a href="https://youtu.be/rXauh1L5z1Q">dub of Jigsaw's monologue</a> and <a href="https://silvershorthair.github.io/author%20tip.png">an image for an author's note</a> at the end.
</li>
<li>
  Although it's not something I considered while writing, Luigi's attempt to diffuse the situation could also 
  be because he's also benefitted from nepotism and so Kenny and Coach's words made him uncomfortable.
